				<p>It's all too familiar. You have a lot to get done today, so you are planning on a quick website update. Your big event is tonight and you need to add a little more information to your event page. You type in your url and your site redirects to a page that is definitely not your church's website! You try again just to make sure. Yep, you've been hacked!</p>

				<p>Before anyone will notice a single word on your website they will notice your graphics. Listen closely. If they are cheap, cute, or known as "clipart" you will be mocked! The good news is that you don't have to be a graphic designer or own photoshop to have nice graphics. Here's a few resources and tips to make you look like good!</p>

				<p>There are two things you need to know about web graphics. First, is that size matters! When it comes to the web, smaller is better. Next up is using correct proportions. Certain areas of your website will call for specific image sizes. I'll explain in a bit. Before we get the details, let's go over a few photoshop alternatives.</p>

WordPress is a content management system that makes it incredibly easy to edit and update a website. It also makes it fairly easy to build a website from the ground up.</p>

				<p>Did you know that 17% of cellphone owners do not own a personal computer. Instead they use their smartphones as their only connection to your website. 55% of all cellphone owners are visiting your website on their phones alongside their desktop computers. This means, the church needs to start thinking differently about their online presence.</p>
